Welcome to my Github Portfolio! My name is David Xue and I am an alumni from Boston University where I majored in Business Administration and Management dual concentrating in Finance And Management Information Systems! I am currently working as a Consultant but I am seeking to pivot into the Data Analysis and Data Science realm. You will find my projects in the Portfolios tab!
